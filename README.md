This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Firebase Realtime Database security rules. The bug involves inconsistent behavior when a custom function in the security rules attempts to access deeply nested data that doesn't exist.  The inconsistent behavior can make securing the database difficult and is not well-documented.  The `firebase-security-bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `firebase-security-solution.js` offers a solution.
